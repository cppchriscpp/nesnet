# Hello World Network App

This is a NESNet demo that shows off the 4 different request types it supports. It simply sends some data to a
php script that echoes them all back. By default I point this at my server, but the URL can be changed to point
at yours by editing echo.c.

Instructions will be provided on-screen with the rom.
